# Random Password Generator 
A web application that uses prompts and takes input from the user in order to generate a random and secure password
## Description
The goal of this project was to make password generator that prompts the user to give input in order to tailor a custom randomly generated password. The resulting password is randomized in order to offer high security and protect the end user against potential hacking attempts.

## Usage
The user is advised to click the "generate password" button and then follow the prompts, the first input receives a numerical input between 8-128 which will be the total length of the generated password. There are then prompts asking the user if they would like lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters in the generated password. When the user has responded to all of the prompts, a password then appears on the screen in the text area.

## In The Future
Future improvements on this application include using jquery or custom modals in order for the prompts to have the option of "yes" or "no" as opposed to ok/cancel.
